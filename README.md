# User Stories:
1. "It would be helpful if the app allowed users to quickly add applied jobs by filling in fields such as company name, job title, link and application date, such as progress('Applied,' 'Interview Scheduled,' 'Offer Received,' and ‘Rejected’).”

2. “It would be helpful to create a user profile so I can save my progress and login using email.”

3. "It would be useful if I could get reminders for application deadlines or upcoming interview stages via email/sms. (3 days until OA deadline).”

4. “Before an interview, I would like to receive examples of interview questions from that company, based on my job applications or the technologies that are written in the job description.”

5. "I would like the app to send me notifications to remind me to follow up on a job application after a certain period (3 weeks since last update) to check the status.”

6. "It would be useful if the app had a visual dashboard with charts showing the progress of applications, including the number of jobs applied, interviews scheduled, and offers received.”

7. "The app should allow me to upload and manage different versions of my CV and cover letter so I can quickly tailor applications.”

8. “The app should have a nice and friendly interface, so it’s easy to use.”

9. “I would like to receive tips based on job applications and feedback, so I can strengthen specific skills.”

10. "It would be useful if the app allowed me to compare salary offers and benefits from multiple companies to make an informed decision.”
